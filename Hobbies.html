            I like to play casual and competitive gaming.To me video games are another way on telling a story
            where its a bit easier to get the player to feel in certain times of the game.
            Or just to have a good time playing games with friends online or locally. My passion for gaming
            even inspired me to make a game of my own with four of my friends, in which we called "The Crying Woman".

        <td>
          I like to look around in my computer's files and add on to the computer's software. It also goes for video games
          since some video games which allows players to mod the game, meaning the game's code is open to be edited or use of
          its game items to be used in any way to further make your game more enjoyable.

        <td>
          Ever since the creation of my group's first game "The Crying Woman" i've been wanting to know 
          on how to improve the game even further. Although I know more when it comes to 3D modeling
          because I was able to make my first, very poorly, human model. But I would want to know more in coding 
          which I hope I can learn in computer science.
