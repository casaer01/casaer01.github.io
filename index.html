        <h2>
        I was born in Chicago, where I grew up in a community called Pilsen.
        Born into a catholic family and put into a catholic school until I reach Highschool.
        From there I realize that I have a passion for code and hardware for computer related stuff.
        Which has led me to join Luther College to futher expand my knowledge, not only in Science
        but also in other aspect of education.
